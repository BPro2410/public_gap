The little fence was lost within days and the shape sorter was taken off because my daughter couldn't figure out how to put them in because of the awkward angle. The little animals, although it's nice that there are a lot of them, have no place to be stored. I now have to have a specific storage container just for them. As others have mentioned, the ""up and down"" is extremely obnoxious and will override the other songs that are playing and, even worse, the animals have to precariously balance in the swing.

I think this is a good solid product. It's not magic, but it does gradually improve the condition of your hair over time. For the people who say it doesn't work at all--yes it does. Possibly your hair was just too damaged for this to help you. There is a point when you've abused hair so much that the only thing you can do is cut it off.I've had color treated and permed hair off and on since I was a kid. Anyway, the last year I've done a lot of lighter colors--peroxide and ammonia really rip up your hair. I've had some very light breakage, weird frizziness only in certain places, and over all my hair wasn't as soft as it used to be.I wasn't sure what to do, short of shaving my head, but I looked around online (especially Amazon) and found this product. I bought it, it shipped promptly, and I really thought it improved my hair's condition. It probably took 3-4 applications to see the results promised. 1 application helps, but 3-4 is what it takes to truly glue hair back together at the strand level. I hope it hasn't been discontinued. The last seller I bought it from canceled my order with vague information that they had no idea when they'd get more from the manufacturer. So if you read this, my advice is to stock up.",beauty,hair care,hair scalp treatments,254,beauty,True

There will be some litter on the top of the unit, but that is by design and is not an issue.We don't use the liners for this, but just clean it out and periodically dump the litter for a new batch. When we do that, we'll wash it out, which is not a big deal. The unit is basically like a large storage bin with a smooth hole cut out of the top. Very clever design, which works well.

I've also tried a number of the ""multi-blade"" razors out there, and found that one blade gets just as close as five. My fall back go to razor has always been a bic sensitive skin disposable razor. They are inexpensive and always perform and get closer than any multi-blade or electric razor ever could. I then decided to try a straight razor, the Parker SR1 Stainless Steel Straight Edge Razor to be exact. I didn't want to try an expensive one or one that required sharpening and stropping, because I really wasn't sure how it was going to work out for me. Long story short, I almost cut my head off on more than one occasion, so I retired it and chalked it up to my inexperience with that particular type of razor. It is a good razor and uses disposable blades, but just not for me. Then I decided to try the old school safety razor, specifically this one. It is very solid, heavy, and smaller than the bic disposables I'm used to, but then again I never really grabbed a razor with my whole fist either. I have to say that this is by far the best razor I have ever used. I shave daily and can forsee using this daily, and I can also see that it would work well with thicker beards and moustaches as well. The weight is nice as it makes shaving easier, smoother, and more fluid, I can say that I honestly shave faster, get a cleaner shave, and no nicks, tugs, or cuts with it.

8723,B000056JND,Philips Avent 3 Pack Bottles,A1YZJS02NOOQEZ,2/3,5.0,1172361600,"These bottles are great! My breastfed baby took to them very easily, and now that she's older, the 4oz size makes a very good container to put cereal and other solid foods in (with the sealing discs). A benefit to these bottles is their ability to effectively and easily reduce the amount of air the baby swallows. As she is drinking from the bottle, you can actually see the air bubbles being released into the bottle in between sucks.In response to other posts about the bottles leaking, we have only used these bottles, and they have never leaked (even with mommy hurrying to pack bottles when running late). I have even dropped a bottle full of milk on the floor (several times), no leaks!I love that you can interchange the nipples and sealing discs, so I can have bottles or storage containers, depending on what I need! I also bought the Avent Breastpump Conversion kit ($9), so I can use my Medela pump to pump directly into the Avent bottles.All the bottle parts are dishwasher-safe, but I choose to clean the nipples myself with a nipple brush, just to be thorough. The rings, sealing discs, caps, and bottles themselves clean up very well in the dishwasher.These bottles are durable! Like I said, I have dropped them on the floor, pumped into them, run them through the dishwasher, sterilized them, boiled them (before I had a sterilizer), and they don't show any signs of wear at all! The bottles themselves are a very hard plastic, which can go through several babies without any problems.

I do agaree with everything the prior review said for Pro's and Con's. I do like the petals since without them my nipple gets sucked all the way inside. If the suction is too hard it does become painful but then you can just decrease the suction. I found that at the end of each pumping session I have to massage each breast while the pump is active to get all my milk out though. I'm not sure if this is due to the pump or maybe my breasts are not fitting in the petals/cup correctly. It just prolongs my pumping time.I can deal with all that but I would say the biggest draw back for me is the freezer storage system. I work over an hour from home and are gone for over 10.5 hours. The freezer gel packs last a maximum of 6 hours - I've experimented with this including putting the entire themal bag in the freezer but that didn't lengthen the time. Since the thermal bags are such an odd vertical shape, I can't find any regular liquid freezer packs that are small enough to fit inside the bags. My job offeres a lactation room which has a small refigerator - thank goodness for that -but I'm still going to have a major problem in the summer when I have to travel home in the hot weather and when I have to travel to remote locations. The small gell packs are a major pain since there are so many of them.I can rearrange the parts in the center of the bag so that I have a small horizontal space to fit a different thermal bag. Right now I'm searching for a small bag like that which will fit inside this space and which I can use liquid freezer packs plus fit 2+ 9oz bottles inside - so we'll see. I contacted Avent about this and they offer nothing else.I also need a car adaptor which they currently do not provide but said they were working on it. They have no battery available.Before I purchased this pump I did research between Medella and Avent and thought both were comparable but the real quirks don't become apparent until you start using it!",baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,399,baby products,True

Eating smaller meals is one way to reduce caloric intake. Eating the same size meals with fewer calories is another. Or, lastly, stop the food that you injest from actually being absorbed by your body.Alli works on the principle of the latter, by blocking your body's ability to digest injested fat. And, in contrast to a lot of ads you might see on television, IT WORKS! YAY! I really have to congratulate whatever scientists actually figured out how to do this.Ok, but here's the downside. IT WORKS. Your body doesn't digest the fat, so it just goes through the rest of your digestive tract... and causes all sorts of unpleasant side effects along the way. They're really unpleasant. Seriously. I can't begin to convey how remarkably unpleasant they actually are. No matter what you heard, you will not be prepared. I actually took prescription Orlistat when it came out a few years ago, and, after stopping due to the side effects, I was *still* not prepared when I started Alli again recently.On the other hand, the side effects give you this great incentive to stay away from the pizza & deep fried chicken!!!For me, I eat remarkably healthy most of the time. I try and basically eliminate the need for Alli. But every so often, I get dragged to a business/social dinner or have to travel with few healthy food options available to me.

(I don't have a problem with things like the disposable flossers or the Reach Flossers.) That's just the way it is with these type of flossing tools. I've had similar ones in the past and they're all like that. The plastic does bend/flex a bit and if it was a sturdier, harder plastic, it may provide more floss tension, but then again, it could cause the Flossaid to snap. It's a give n take so it's fine the way it is. Just gotta learn to work with it. With a bit of patience this gets the job done and it's more economical than buying disposable flossers.The Flossaid is a bit on the wide side so if you have a small mouth, or if you plan on getting it for children, it might not work well.I still think that Reach Flossers and disposable flossers are easier to use, but having to buy refills for the Reach Flossers for the entire family gets really expensive so the Flossaids will do fine.",health personal care,personal care,oral hygiene,247,baby products,False

You'll definitely need to be very careful trimming your (ahem) more sensitive areas. While its true that the shaving blades are completely protected from nicking your skin, the vibrating trimmers pointing straight out on either side of the foil can make this shaver even more dangerous than a normal one. I think a good solution would have to involve getting those trimmers out of harm's way, or maybe only putting a trimmer on one side of the foil, not both.Aside from being primed for grabbing and cutting through some very sensitive skin, the trimmers on both sides also mean no matter where you want to shave with the foil, you're leading with a trimmer. This limits what you can and can't do. If you'd like to, for instance, shave bare all the way to the edge of your naughty bits, the trimmer's position means you'll be forced to trim the hair on part of your thigh as well.Good idea for a product, but clearly not as well-tested as it could have been. 3 stars for the quality construction and its ability for most areas, -2 for the dangerous design in the most important spots.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,208,health personal care,True

One scoop of the salts in a tub of water and you transform everyday bathing into bubbles and water the color of the ocean. The color reminded me of the turquoise waters near the Aiya Napa white caves in Cyprus. The texture of the water turns silky and you may notice your skin is more moisturized from the natural oils, especially the Wheat Germ Oil.While many may see the color as ""Azure"" there is a definite green vs. purple color mingling in the depths of blue and this does contain Algae. The texture of the salt is more like a sand than a salt and the shimmering finely ground blue salt crystals mingle with what looks like tiny pieces of broken marble. Of course, this all dissolves quickly and the bubbles last through the entire bath. In fact, the more you move around, the more bubbles appear.The warm scent soothes the soul and the color is dreamy and the bubbles look like clouds floating across an open sky. A shell of salts is all you need and a beautiful shell is included. A natural sponge is in the tin and works well for exfoliating the body.I had so much fun taking a bath with these salts, that I ran my husband a bath too.

38795,B000FSG2Y0,Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Shampoo,A3CI6WYKVK28FY,4/5,3.0,1339891200,"First of all, Amazon has this product listed as ""Well Water Action"" but the product that I received is ""Hard Water Wellness."" At the time, the product photo did not match the description, but I bought it anyway, and now I see that Amazon has changed the photo to match the description, so you might actually receive a different product. Or perhaps the manufacturer has simply changed the name of the shampoo.Anyway, I have had limited success with this shampoo mostly because my particular well water does not work well with detergents. It is very high in manganese but low in iron, making it very difficult for any existing filtration system to remove the manganese because most filters depend on bonding the manganese to the iron in order to remove it. On top of that, our water is very soft (water hardness is not an indicator of all mineral content, but of calcium content only) so any type of water softening does not help me. My hair suffered greatly before we discovered what the problem was -- our water, instead of the shampoo/curling iron/hair dryer, which I kept thinking it was -- but once I began rinsing my hair with vinegar in the rinse water it improved greatly, and even more so when I began the ""no 'poo"" baking soda plus vinegar regimen. I bought this shampoo because it is not always convenient for me to use the baking soda, and sometimes I just want to wash my hair like a ""normal"" person. I can't really use it more than a few days in a row because it does build up on my hair, but at least the build up is not nearly as bad as it is with a regular SLS shampoo. I also wash my 5 year old daughter's hair with it because it is tedious to use baking soda and vinegar on her hair, and it doesn't seem to build up and break her hair off as bad as traditional shampoo either, but we don't wash her hair every day (while I do wash mine every day). Bottom line, if you have well water with a high mineral content, I think it is worth the six bucks to try this stuff and see how it will do with your hair and your water. Plus, it smells really great. Especially compared to vinegar.",beauty,hair care,shampoos,395,beauty,True

Overall the bottles have been a good experience for us. The sleek design is great for the various diaper bags and insulated cooler bag and is easy to handle. The bottle system is easy to clean and there should be no issue of leaks provided the vented disk is inserted back correctly, which is very easy - just run your nail along the inside edge of the vented disk while pressing against the base piece to ensure a snug fit.The only issue that I have with this system is that there is no medium flow nipples. My daughter was sucking so hard and collapsing the nipple at 6 weeks with the Stage 1 nipples and it was beginning to take a long time to feed and she'd wind up frustrated and full of gas. The Stage 2 nipples are too advanced at this point and run very quickly. Before poking any holes or bailing on the systen I tried the Gerber silicon Medium flow replacement nipples (they come in a 6 pack). They fit the bottles and worked like a charm.

I own all of Lee's post-TYA stuff, and he's never yet put out anything that can touch the TYA stuff as far as I'm concerned. Although ""Zoom"" is darn good.That's because TYA was a BAND, where each individual player was a master of their own instrument and played their own material for each song, with the product jelling as music.What's nice about this CD is that the mixes and arrangements allow each instrument equal presence -- just like it was on ""Cricklewood Green"" and ""Watt"" -- not consistently shoving the guitar out front, but making sure it's there when it's got the lead spot.If I had to compare the sound and style of ""Positive Vibrations"" I would call it a mix between ""Watt"" and ""A Space in Time"" -- truly, two classic TYA albums.It has the excellent timing changes within the body of songs like ""Watt,"" and great use of acoustic guitar like ""A Space in Time.""Bass, keyboard, and drums consistently play distinctive elements of the songs, not just background reference for the lead guitar.Speaking of which, Lee's work on this album is -- there's no other words for it -- superbly tasteful. He's not trying to show off at all, but works his notes into intricate patterns that, again, are reminiscent of ""Watt.""Although 1972's ""Rock N Roll Music to the World"" is an excellent album, the sound, mix, and production on that album was and is too Alvin Lee-focused, but with ""Positive Vibrations"" it is the band playing as the band again -- cleanly, and doing it well.As for the lyrics, they're written with the same flavor and level of skill that any of Lee's other stuff ever was. I like them. He's a guitarist, not Wordsworth.Anyway, if you listen to this album and think ""Watt"" and ""A Space in Time,"" and enjoy TYA's jazz/blues rock fusion material, you'll find this album grows on you.It is really very, very good, and it is a sad statement of the times -- then, and now -- that the legend of Alvin Lee's blistering fingers still overshadow the last great effort the full band put out in their original days.If you dust this baby off, I think you'll find a true Ten Years After gem.It does not appear to be remastered, however. Neither BGO's website, nor the CD make that statement. Only the Amazon.com description.

This product is so fantastic that I thought I should take the time to create a positive review.My mother purchased this for me in a store after asking the saleslady what other new moms found very helpful. I was doubtful that I would find it to be extremely useful. Little did I know that I would become inseparable from my trusty Itzbeen! It was like my security blanket for the first 6 months of my son's life! The concept seemed so simple that I underestimated its value, but I see now that moms with tiny babies are so sleep deprived that this timer is very helpful in establishing a routine for your baby.A friend of mine told me that you had to stop watching the clock and read your baby's cues to put them on a schedule. This timer helped me identify that my son actually DID have a routine. Each day we might start our day at a different time, but once our day began, he really was like a well-oiled machine in that he was ready for naptime after the same amount of time had elapsed. He wouldn't nap at exactly 8:30 a.m., for instance, but he would always be ready to nap after he had been up for an hour and a half (just as an example). I didn't have to worry about remembering the last time he ate or how long he had napped - the Itzbeen remembered for me. This timer is also great for leaving your baby with a spouse, grandparent or sitter who won't be as familiar with your baby's routine.Another huge plus - it helps a great deal with the night-time feedings. I woke up more than once in a panic in the middle of the night convinced that I had skipped a feeding and my baby had been crying for 6 hours straight. I was so tired that I really couldn't remember our last feeding. I would look at the Itzbeen and realize that it had only been 3 hours and my baby was just waking up for his next feeding. As he began to sleep through the night for longer periods, it helped me see how long he was going between feedings, and that gave me hope. Because the night feedings were such a blur, I would not really have known for sure if we were making progress.I am now purchasing this for a friend as a baby shower gift.

The larger size is a great improvement, and we love the spring retention band with the clips compared to the simple piece of stiff hooked wire on the old bottle.But there are a couple of annoying shortcomings:* Don't like the angle on the ""spout."" It's too wide or obtuse. If you hold the bottle flat against the outside of the cage, the end of the spout doesn't really reach inside the cage -- it's almost even with the side of the bottle! You have to insert the spout first and lever the bottle's top end which collapses the plastic a bit near the spout (see next complaint), so the bottle doesn't actually sit flat against the cage -- the top end angles away. This could be remedied with a slightly tighter bend in the spout, maybe 5 degrees more? I thought about heating it up and trying to do this myself, but would be afraid the metal would collapse at the bend, or the heat would distort the circumference and cause a leak around the ball or around the cap.* Plastic is very soft, causing it to collapse near the cap end where the cage bars compress it when the spring retainer pulls it tight. Again I think this is caused by the angle of the spout, which hits the cage bar underneath and applies pressure to this point when the retainer is attached. My concern is this crease in the plastic will eventually break through and leak.* Minor gripe with the little yellow floating duck that's supposed to serve as a water level indicator. It has a disk on the bottom presumably as a ballast to make it float upright, but it's not heavy enough. So ours looks like a dead duck, always floating on its side. Not really a problem, since the actual water line is more visible to me than the duck, but my wife thought it was a cute addition until it wouldn't float upright. You can remove the duck if you don't want it.As for those complaining of leakage, all such bottles like this I've seen will leak at first. You have to ""prime"" it after filling to get the vacuum to seal. After filling, hold it over the sink while you tap the ball several times. This releases some water and you'll see air bubbles rise in the bottle. After several taps it should seal and stop leaking. Problem is, again, due to the soft plastic and the angle of the spout, it's impossible to install on the cage without squeezing it, which inevitably causes some initial leakage into the cage. Have a napkin handy to catch the water while you re-prime. Once installed and primed, ours has never leaked.",pet supplies,small animals,feeding watering supplies,470,pet supplies,True

It hurt SOOOOOOO much less than the Medela pump I had. The cushions help....they really do. As a mother I am making a sacrifice to feed my child breast milk, and to be in pain just doesn't make sense. Those first days/months are hard. When it came to buying a breast pump I found this one on line for the money I could afford and the reviews were ok. I thought if the hand pump doesn't hurt and these are the bottles I am using anyway I went for it. I am VERY Glad I did. It works like a charm.

Your breasts will thank you and your son/daughter will to because you will not be in pain.Good Luck to all the moms trying breast feeding.FYI- Don't purchase an electric pump until after your baby is here and you make that long term sacrifice.

For starters, it does not contain the harsh detergent Sodium Laurel Sulfate, which most conventional shampoos have. SLS strips the oils from your hair, leaving your hair damaged, and with an overproduction of oil to compensate. This overproduction makes you need to wash your hair constantly to keep the oil at a reasonable level. This shampoo does not have SLS in it, and I can go quite a while without washing it - usually my skin feels yucky long before my hair starts to feel gross in any way.Of course, my hair took about a week to get used to the sudden lack of SLS in my shampoo - which caused it to be very, very greasy for a few days to a week. I recommend that if you switch to JR Liggett's, you do it at a time that you will not have to go out very much (I did it during summer vacation from school). Do NOT let this adjustment period discourage you from using this fantastic product, though! It's SO worth it because it makes my hair really, really soft and thick, and my curls look nicer than when I used SLS based shampoos!Besides the SLS factor, JR liggett's is more environmentally friendly. It comes wrapped only in a small piece of paper, rather than a large plastic bottle. Also, you don't need conditioner because the oils in the shampoo bar do the job of conditioner (so, one less plastic bottle). It saves me a lot of money - even if $6 seems a bit much for a 3.5 ounce bar, you must take in to consideration the fact that you don't need to buy conditioner and that the bar lasts to between 6 months and a year! The scent it exudes is a mild herbal scent and in a pinch it can be used as a body soap as well. When I go on my church's mission trip each year, I use it as shampoo, and body soap, and shaving soap and it works just fine.I recommend that when you use it, you put it in your hair right when you get it wet, and leave it in until the very end of your shower (after you've soaped your body, shaved your legs, etc) to get the softest hair possible.To sum it up, JR Liggett's is a fantastic, environmentally responsible product with all-natural and safe ingredients, and I highly recommend it.",beauty,bath body,cleansers,422,beauty,True

I thought it would save time to apply a huge section and take it off in sections. If anything it only made more of a mess and made it harder to properly apply the cloth.-Use more of a peeling motion, not a ripping motion. The instructions don't clarify this, but I found that a swift peel resulted in cleaner results and less pain than just trying to rip the strip off.-Don't be afraid to reheat. You tend to get lazy when it starts to get thick again, but its way easier to spread when warm.-Do small patches around thick hair, unless of course you like excruciating pain.-The cloth is washable and reusable.

People have suggested they substitute Parsley for Oregano. I'd rather they replace the Red Rubin basil. I have recipes with oregano, but none specifically calling for purple basil. However, I never tasted the stuff, so I may change my mind once I do. Hopefully they included it becase of taste and not for looks.This is an easy, low maintenence kit. You only have to refil the water bowl when the water gets low & add 2 nutrient tablets every 2 weeks.

They may collect them but mostly it's the younger girls who want to actually play with them. Maybe Bratz are a bad influence, but they can't be much worse then what we see on t.v and in the news everyday. My Scene are pretty, but I wish they looked more like the girls in the movie.

The spill on the Scotchgarded portion beaded up while the unprotected portion soaked the wine up right away. I let it sit for a few minutes and eventually the wine did absorb into the material. When I tried to remove the stain from both sections (using only water), the red wine actually came out of the treated side while the untreated side appeared to be stained. The results were very impressive! I'm on the ""what else can I apply this to?"" bandwagon now.Amount needed - I treated an extra large sofa and a small fully upholstered chair with two coats each and used 4.5 cans (10 oz size). Found that using painters tape to mark the untreated areas helped me remember where I had or had not spayed since I couldn't really see a significant change in the fabric's appearance and when I would look away to open my second can of Scotchgard I would lose my place.Smell. If you've ever stepped into a small nail salon that applies acrylic nails, that's about what this stuff smells like to me. Since I currently live in a high rise, I was concerned about the ventilation requirements since I can only open a patio door and crack a window.

I dropped this one time and the thing was done. cracked and i couldn't get a replacement. Also this shaver will not shave any beard longer than 2 mm very well. it takes many strokes over the area which also can cause some irritation. I find if you do have longer growth trim it with the trimming attachment (This works great and is also good for just creating the stubble look) then shave over it with the foil screen. I had recently upgraded to the Braun Series 5 Shaver. Wow. This beast gets the job done! Trimmer works great and the shaving is closer and you can definitely shave a 4 or 5 mm beard easily with the cutting comb in the center. I did have to buy a real beard trimmer for times when i do want it a bit longer.

While I was impressed with the beautiful detail of the castle itself I was suprised with the size. The castle itself appears to be a good size but the inside is small and really there is no room to play with the dolls. My daughter has had it for 3 days and really has not played all that much with it. Santa is bringing her the loving family twin dollhouse for x-mas and that I think she will enjoy more since there is all the accesories that you can put inside the house and can actually play inside the house with the dolls P.S. THe carraige that you can buy seperatly (which she also got) the horse does not stand up by itself!,toys games,dolls accessories,dollhouses,181,toys games,True

We recently moved to a big city, and our gate is now inches away from the sidewalk, with people coming and going past the dogs all day. Our dog's never been aggressive, but since moving here she has been barking like crazy and her hair stands up like she's terrified or ready to kill. Our old place was a hundred feet away from the street, so we think she just got used to people being further away and now the new place freaks her out.Anyway, out of fear for pedestrians' safety, and out of a desire for her not to torture herself by freaking out all the time, we decide on this petsafe collar. Man...talk about an instant fix. First I put the collar on my own arm (my wife refused:) to get a voltage that was uncomfortable but not painful; for ours, it was 3. Then I put it on the poocho, and, lo and behold, she started her thing a few moments later. I pushed the button, but not long enough to get the shock--it just beeped, and she stopped and looked kind of confused. She then continued again, so I zapped her. She immediately stopped, turned away and laid down. I was like, ""Are you serious?"" This happened two more times that day, only one of which I had to zap her.Now, it's been a couple of weeks--my dog doesn't bark anymore, I don't have to yell at her anymore, and she is unbelievably happy now. Maybe once every few days I have to give her the warning sound, but she immediately stops doing whatever she's doing at the time and lays down.Amazing concept!Regarding this specific product, the design and build are both great. It comes with a lanyard to hang the remote around your neck. The range has been fine--I can use it from my 2nd-story loft about a 150' away from the dog with no problem (through several walls etc).The only complaint I have is the fact that the batteries have to be recharged every night, even if the product wasn't used that day. This is an easy fix for us, since the dogs sleep inside at night, but for others it may be a problem.What a relief!",pet supplies,dogs,training behavior aids,388,pet supplies,True

They didn't look like acne to me, they looked like my skin was having a allergic reaction to something I put on it and the pharmacist at CVS agreed with that notion. I stopped using this and kept treating my skin with the addition of topical cortisone and a oral anti-histamine to my routine. That same day the irritating feeling and bumps slowly but surely started to go away. With in I'd say 3-4 days the bumps were completely gone! Fast forward about 1 month later silly me wanted to be SURE this was what caused my reaction (and not a cheaper detergent I started using around the same time I initially broke out) so 2 days ago I smeared some more of this stuff on and when I woke up the next morning...whoomp there they were, more of the same small, iritating bumps.

He is fascinated by the types of equipment that we have at our facility for repair and has asked me tons of questions to which I don't have the answers (I am not a technician). I ordered this set for him as a Christmas gift since I knew it was something that would interest him, but it was not something that he had asked for. After the dust settled under the tree, imagine my surprise when it was the first gift he opened to play with. He very quickly built the ""flying saucer"" and the ""space war"" models. The instructions are fantastic- in color and easy to follow with explanations for each model. And the number of models and variations that can be built with this set will keep him busy for quite some time. He hasn't even had it a week and has played with it 4 or 5 times already. I am also impressed with the quality of this set. The parts seem to be durable and should stand up to the demands of a very curious 8 year old.As for the educational/learning value of this set, I can honestly say that he has truly learned something from playing with it and I think he is very proud of what he has learned. Today he went with me to my office and he started up a conversation with one of the technicians (who was in the process of repairing a large circuit board) about circuit boards, resistors, jumper cords - all items at the technician's station, that he had just learned about with this set.

Lesson learned after I had to buy another box of sticks to finish out month two when it started me testing on day eight. I think next month I will just time it so I only have to use half a box per cycle (15 sticks). Just start testing a few days later than the machine tells me to and stop testing after peak day will certainly cut down on stick usage and cost.Cons -- After you have spent morning after morning looking at the lines on the stick and seeing which one(s) show, it is easy to predict what the machine is going to say. I sort of feel ripped off by having to use the machine to tell me what I can plainly see with my own eyes. But the machine makes it easy to keep track of cycle days and it is an easy reminder to test, so I am not overly upset.I also find it easier and more accurate to use the ""dip in a cup"" method over the ""running stream"" method. Just use a disposable Dixie cup - much less messy and splashy.I am not sorry I bought the system -- I just need to tweak it a bit so that the sticks actually last me for three months. Gave it four stars because it DOES what it is supposed to do, took away one star because it gets expensive to use as directed if you have any issues at all with your cycle.My suggestion is to not rely too heavily on this machine and take the time to learn your body signs since sometimes signs come later in the day, even when you have had a low fertility reading in the morning.

For 'paralysis tick' protection, bi-weekly application is recommended but results are not guaranteed.The product comes in a number of 'pipettes' that contain an oily-sticky liquid that is applied on the back of the dog's neck's, on the skin (must part the coat until the skin is visible). The makers recommend monthly applications.I found it easy to treat the dogs. Given the relatively high price of this product, I've been using one pipette for our 2 puppies.

Proactiv has proved effective over the years but I had a few problems with the products:1. The Price... For a cleanser, toner and moisturizer I was paying $45 dollars a month.2. The Amount... I could NEVER get the cleanser and toner to last me the full month. To cover my face I needed half the bottle, and it is NOT an effective makeup remover.3. Dryness... dried my skin out BAD. And the moisturizer sucked, but I couldn't customize my order to remove it.After much research, debate and watching the infomercial over several times over I decided to switch to Philosophy. Now if you purchase Philosophy products individually it does get pretty spendy, but no more or less than other department store facial products. As a package it's a helluva deal.I got the cleanser, moisturizer, retinol, exfoliating cleanser, eye/lip cream, shampoo/body wash, lip gelato, another exfoliating cream, and the Vitamin C booster AND A FREE GIFT for LESS than what I paid for my three rinky dinky Proactiv products.For 8 products I paid $109.00 for 3 months. 3 months of Proactiv is $135, at the least.The Philosophy product themselves have been life changing for me. If I absolutely had to choose one that I love the best I would have to say it's the Help Me.This stuff is absolutely amazing. My skin is very sensitive to retinol, and continuous use of it for me on a weekly basis usually leads to a rash. This product seems to have enough retinol to do the job, but not enough to make me get a burn. I swear, within a FEW DAYS I noticed a difference, and I wasn't the only one. My husband has raved about the lack of lines under my eyes, and swear the product has taken years off of my face. Like all of Philosophy's stuff a little goes a long way, and always put moisturizer on afterwards, especially with the Help Me. Retinol is extremely beneficial to skin, but one must handle it with care. Frankly, I am not sure if it is the Help Me alone that has done it, or a combination of the Philosophy products I have invested in.

12635,B000GGD3O8,North States Supergate Auto-Close Metal Gate,A3ELP2H0N3ZAX1,119/120,3.0,1201737600,"After a long search for a quality top-of-stairs gate, this is what I decided to buy. Although it works OK it could be better.Two things really bother me about this gate. First, Amazon is selling it as a pressure-mounted gate. This isn't exactly true. While technically it is pressure-mounted, you also need to use the cups that come with and either stick them on or screw them into the wall. This gate is not designed to have a firm mount, it uses hand wheels to adjust tension. As a result, it's not sturdy enough to use without the wall mount cups, meaning you won't be able to move it around much. The hand wheels are ""tamper proof"", basically meaning that they are a pain to loosen. Since this gate can't be set up in multiple places easily anyway, this shouldn't be a problem. Nevertheless, I would prefer wrench-adjusted tension for a more secure fit and the ability to mount the gate without the cups. This would require a redesign, as it doesn't take much pressure to close the gap at the top when installing (compared to true pressure-mounted gates).Second, I thought this gate was made in the USA. This statement is prominently displayed on North State's website today. But it is actually now made in China. This was a factor in my decision and I don't appreciate inaccurate websites.Now, to the details. This gate was easy to setup and did not require any tools. Previously I had purchased a Summer Infant Extra Tall gate but returned it because I was not satisfied with the gate mechanism. I couldn't get it to operate both smoothly and safely at the same time. The release mechanism on this North States gate works very well. The auto-close feature also works well. However, whether or not you will like that feature is another thing.It became immediately apparent that the auto-close feature can be a pain in a high-traffic area. Keep in mind this gate is not easy to remove, so once installed you will need to open it each and every time you go through it unless you rig up your own doorstop to hold it open. The main advantage is that it will always be closed, and that makes it safer. I prefer the safety, but I can see where some people might get annoyed.It also closes with a fairly loud clang, which can be a nuisance when you have a sleeping baby. The metal latch is pulled into place by a magnet so even if you manually close the gate, it will probably clang, although sometimes you get lucky and it doesn't. A little duct tape over the magnet helps.Another thing to keep in mind is that since this is a top-of-stairs gate, it will only open in one direction and it cannot be setup to operate in both directions at the same time.As with all pressure-mount gates, there is a steel bar at the bottom of the gate that you will need to step over.All in all, this is still the best top-of-stairs gate I have been able to find. It does the job I need it to. But obviously it isn't the most flexible gate and there is a lot of room for improvement. If you don't need a top-of-stairs gate, I would recommend The First Years Hands Free gate, which we use in our kitchen. But please remember that if you need a gate at the top of the stairs, there are only a handful available that are designed for this, and they are all hardware mounted.UPDATE 8/11**********************A commenter has stated this gate now opens in both directions, which would make it unsuitable for top of stairs use. I don't know if the design changed of if the commenter has a slightly different model, but buyer beware.",baby products,safety,gates doorways,637,baby products,True

It's a matter of how the nipple fits into the cap and how the cap and nipple screw onto the bottle.Trust me, as a dude I went through all of the above. Brand new out of the box or used over 6 months you just have to resign to the fact that these things have a tendency to spill out.DUDE's GUIDE TO LEAKING BOTTLE:A. After filling the bottle's content, cap it and shake or tip the bottle over the sink. Allow contents to spill out of nipple. Then tip the bottle upright. It is at that time you will know if your bottle is leaking or not. If it is leaking, proceed to Step B. If it is not leaking, repeat process a couple more times just to be sure. Feed baby.B. If the bottle does spill or leak, unscrew the cap and use a paper towel or bib and dry the inside threads of the white cap.Dry the external threads of the bottle as well. Screw on cap. Reef on it like you mean it (usually you're PO'd by now so a little agression helps). Repeat Step A.Avent bottles are based of a simple principle of channelling air through the nipple/cap threads rather than having the baby backwash (ala chugging a Dr. Pepper from a bottle). It needs to draw air. While eating, just make sure the nipple is at least 1/2 way in the baby's mouth and his lips/mouth are WIDE open as if he was nursing.These moms that say they have to tip their baby upside down etc. is baloney. Tip the bottle - DUH! And as for air/gas/burping, all babies suck air while nursing/bottle-fed. Babies do that. They still have the breathe-thru-nose-while-eating mechanism after doing the same for months in the womb.So trust me. It takes a little work to understand these things. These ARE good bottles and they DO work. Just be aware of the above.Hope this helps.",baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,349,baby products,True

But after reading the reviews, I thought I should post this information about a different stand on tandem stroller...If you don't like this Joovy stroller, try the Baby Trend Sit-N-Stand LX. I just bought it for my tall 2 1/2 year old son and our soon to arrive baby. There is plenty of room for my older son to sit (sitting forward or backwards) or stand even with the front seat in its ""back"" position and with the infant carrier sitting in the front seat. Infant seat ""snaps"" into the front seat just like the regular and convenient Baby Trend Snap-n-Go. It has 2 cup holder tray for parent and a tray for front seat. The handle bars are tall enough for tall people (I am 5'10""). The front seat seems more cushioned than the Joovy. The stroller turns fine while children are in their seats.One downside, similar to the Joovy, is that the front seat does not lay all the way flat to accomodate sleeping babies which can be remedied by just placing the baby and the infant carrier into the front seat. Another downside, it is a tight fit to get the stroller into my car which is just a four door (not a SUV) but it does have a big trunk for a 4-door; I have to take the canopy off the stroller before putting it into the trunk. Fortunately, the canopy comes off real easily, so it is no big deal.It is also less expensive than the Joovy.Regardless of your choice, enjoy and blessings!",baby products,strollers,tandem,276,baby products,True

Also, I suspect there is alittle bit of quality control issues, and sometimes you'll find someone got a lemon.That being said, this is a fun little gun that I purchased to keep the hordes of code toads (aka programmers) from overrunning my cube at work.It's not the best nerf gun ever, heck the Hasbro Nerf N-Strike Maverick, listed on amazon for 1/3 of the price is probably the best non-modded handgun you can buy atm.This one lacks power, and it'd be smarter to buy a $5 bottle of glow in the dark paint than attach these stickers (which lose sticky fast and then just jam up the darts in the tubes).The action is good but not for super fast shooting, I use the sonic or velcro darts mostly (painted for night action) and they work much better.all in all, its a decent little gun, if you want 20ft+ I'd suggest googling 'nerf mods' and buying a dremel/ton of super glue, because while they could've made this gun alot better, I suppose they could've made it alot worse as well.My suggestion, buy a Hasbro Nerf N-Strike Maverick, follow some of the easy mods, and have a nice concealable longer shooting gun for alot less money.Nerf on!",toys games,dress up pretend play,pretend play,271,grocery gourmet food,False

I hate coloring my hair but refuse to pay to have my hair colored at the salon. This Colorjoi is the only product on the market (AFAIK) that helps with home hair coloring.This product is not complicated to use. Just load the chamber with your mixed hair color then press the button to advance the hair color out of the prongs. Brush your hair with the device (like using a bulky hair brush) while holding the button down and the hair color is distributed to the root and along the length of your hair.The Colorjoi works quite well and is much easier than sectioning hair into tiny lines and squeezing hair color along each part then combing through. I would recommend doing the back of the head separately first (the instructions only say to do that for long hair, but I think it would work best for all lengths), to make sure that the hair underneath is completely covered with hair color. I have shoulder-length hair and section the back into two sections (top of back and bottom of back) then section the front/top into right and left sides. When using the Colorjoi, I am careful to cover all areas of my head and I use a comb after putting on the color to better distribute to the ends of my hair.The Colorjoi comes with two types of color diffusers, one for overall coloring and one for root coloring. I have only used the overall coloring one.It holds one standard size box of haircolor and needs to be re-loaded if you use additional hair color (i usually use 1 1/2 boxes). It is not difficult to re-load, though - just unscrew the color diffuser, press down on the bottom and add more hair color.It is somewhat difficult to clean, although the hair color chamber does easily remove from the base/handle. Even though it says to throw out the color diffuser (what the previous review was complaining about), I just wash it and reuse. It is made of heavy plastic, too heavy to seem ""disposable"". I put the diffuser directly under the faucet to wash out the prongs and tap it on the bottom of the sink to get the haircolor out. Just hold up to a light to see if the prongs are clean.I did not find the written instructions long or confusing. It also comes with DVD instructions to watch a video on how it is used.I do like this appliance. It makes haircoloring so much easier for me. I used to have a very hard time coloring my hair by myself, especially the back of my head. The Colorjoi makes it much easier and I would recommend it.

The size is stated as 19""-24"", but even when it's buckled at the tightest notch, the collar is still a little over 27"", which is so big that they can slide easily over the heads of my two 75-lb Golden Retrievers. So it's a great collar for night-safety purposes, but really bad for dog-restraint purposes.The collars so inexpensive that it didn't seem worth the trouble to return them, so when I take the dogs out at night, I just slip the reflective collars on along with their regular collars, kind of like a necklace rather than a dog collar, which actually works pretty well.

Roll the three die and match the colors of the die to the colors of the eight, tri-colored farm animals. When a player makes a match, they make the sound of the farm animal (hence the name of the game ""Quack Quack""). The first player to make the correct animal sound gets a point; the player to reach four points wins. Appropriate for 2 - 4 non-color-blind players.The game pieces are constructed of thick wood, beautifully painted in six bright colors, and come in a small wooden box of the same high quality with a cloth bag to store the pieces.The rules are simple for ages five and up, but too complex for a three year old. Initially, I was put off by this fact, until I realized that the game is easily scaled down to match my 3 year old's capabilities. Even modified, the game is still entertaining. For the last six months, my son has had a blast attempting to match the colors using only 2 of the 3 die (the third die adds too much complexity). Of course, making the animal sounds is his favorite part. Now I appreciate the fact that the game can grow with him--we will add new facets to the game until he's able to play the game as described in the instructions. I look forward to many years playing this game with him.I also like the fact that the game is short (8-10 minutes for our son), perfect for three and four year olds with equally short attention spans! For the older set, you'll want to play multiple times.Educationally, the game helps develop color matching skills and teaches how to eliminate alternatives.

I have been diabetic for 37 years and have been using an insulin pump for 30 years. The heat during summer months has been an ongoing problem for me for more than 27 years. The heat became a critical problem about three years ago. I worked in a warehouse in Texas for 9 years and most of the time was seated close to a overhead air conditioning vent. However, about three years ago I was relocated to an area where the air conditioning had little effect and the summer months were miserable. My blood sugars would sky rocket and I was having difficulty keeping it down. I searched and searched for a resolution to my problem. My doctor changed my insulin to one that was not as heat sensative, but this did not solve the problem. Then one night I came across an article telling about the Frio Pump Wallet and how it had been tested in the field, used during climbs up mountains, camping, jogging, and many other outdoor activities. So, I went to the internet and searched for Frio and located their website. Thank God for that article! I have used my Frio Pump Wallet for the last three years.

I had read the reviews and it seemed that the majority were good so I decided to try it out. I was amazed at how quickly it arrived. I immediately opened it and put it together. I did have a little trouble with the clips, as mentioned in other posts, but it wasn't a big deal for me. My 2 cats were wary of using it at first. I already had one covered box and one uncovered box so I didn't think having the cover on would deter them, but they steered clear of it that first day so I took the top off until I saw it had been used. I put the top back on the next day and they've been using it ever since. I love how easy it is to use. I got to the point that I hated having to scoop my other box when this one was so easy to do, so last week I ordered another one and now I can clean both boxes in less time than it used to take to clean one. I use World's Best Cat Litter and have had no problems. I had read some of the reviews that mentioned the poo sticking to the grill, so I just make sure that I don't clean the box right after they have used it. My cats don't cover theirs, but the litter seems to draw out the moisture quickly so it has hardened by the time I empty the box. So far I haven't had any trouble with anything sticking to the grill. My husband always used to complain about the smell from the litter boxes and since I've been using this one we haven't noticed a smell at all. That is probably due to the fact that I am actually cleaning it every day so it never has much in it. In the past I would put it off thinking I didn't have time right then to do it. Now, I just clean it when I get home from work and it's done in less than a minute! I highly recommend this box. The little bit of litter that may spill when you are turning it is nothing compared to the litter the cats used to kick out of the other litter boxes I had. And because it is covered I don't find little ""presents"" on the floor where the cat missed the box while doing her business.

The difference between the 2 is incredible. This razor isn't as noisy as many of the reviews would lead you to believe. Where the norelco made a horrible screeching/grinding sound, this razor is more like a humming bird pleasantly flying around your head. The shave really is smooth and comfortable with little to no irritation. Conversely, the norelco would leave my neck looking like I'd been wrestling a cougar.I had heard that rotary razors handle long hairs better but I beg to differ after using both. The 2 position trimmer works great for finishing off those stubborn hairs that just won't stand up. I also love being able to get a nice clean edge on my beard. As others have said, it takes a bit of guess work with a rotary razor and was always difficult to get it looking nice (not to mention that if I got it to close it would just start yanking hairs).The maintenance of this razor is also much, much quicker and easier than my old rotary. I used to schedule time to disassemble and clean my norelco. Now, a quick brushing or rinse and lube and I'm good to go.The only place I can fault this razor is that the clippings seem to leak out a little while shaving.

That refined salt in the grocery store is extremely damaging to your body, causing many problems like high blood pressure for one.Your body desperately needs natural salt, but the refined versions most of us grew up with have had all the nutrients processed out of them. There are something like 70 or 80 trace elements in a good sea salt that are essential for your body's health. Under ideal conditions, we would receive these from our food we eat. But in today's world, the soil is depleted of these critical nutrients - so that even if you try to eat good natural food, it no longer contains what you need. So sea salt to the rescue.Having learned all this a few years back, I bought some Redmond's and gave it a try - and promptly went into shock. I knew it would be good for me, but I still expected it to taste the same as all salt - but it was, ""OMG! THIS IS WHAT SALT IS SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE??!!!"" It was a delightful bouquet of flavors and so satisfying to the taste buds. Even if regular salt wasn't so bad for you, I could never go back just because of the taste - there is no comparison.And don't be fooled by most grocery store brands - even Morton's sells sea salt - and it tastes just like the same old crap that's been in our salt shakers all these years.One other tip to try",grocery gourmet food,herbs,spices seasonings,263,grocery gourmet food,True

He sits inside a ring that holds him (up to what age, still remains to be seen), has room for his legs to stick out, while it gives us room to clean his head and back, and we can rotate the ring with him inside as needed.So far, he's loving it (I guess, the fact that it allows him to sit in water helps) as he can splash and play with his bath toys, while we can get him clean for his nightsleep. The two challenges we've found are cleaning his belly (since he's compelled to be pushing it against the front of the ring, trying to reach his toys) and getting him into the seat (getting his legs in the proper spots), but this last thing is something that almost ALL seating gear for babies have an &quot;issue&quot; with.In any case, two words of advice:1) Measure your bathtub, to make sure the seat fits it. I can see how some other reviewers might have had a hard time with this, since it doesn't seem to fit all sizes.2) If you get it, when you use it, never leave your baby unattended, no matter how safe or great it feels (which it does!)Otherwise, highly recommendable.

I don't--WON'T-follow instructions to the letter (2X/day? Organic apples, bananas, blueberries? Purified water?) And I'm not a die-hard health nut, so I don't mind adding in soy (milk), or dairy (kefir), or nuts (almond butter).Still, it's a lot of nutrition for the price (&lt;$1/meal); a bargain even if you factor in the added fruit. And an ""ultimate"" bargain if you factor in the supplements provided (vitamins, minerals, herbal supplements) that you'd need to buy separately. Probably should check these ingredients, though, to make sure you can tolerate them.There's no getting around the greens-flavored taste of this powder, but it's no worse than other superfood beverages. The product's website has some good recipes and suggestions. One I've used is similar to what's on the canister (minus the ""organic""), except I substitute vanilla soymilk for the water (flavor/thickness). I include 1/2 cup frozen raspberry/blueberry mix that changes the color from green to purplish and sweetens the flavor. (I know fresh is better, but--trust me--cold is what helps makes this concoction palatable.)After three days of drinking this for breakfast, I felt more energized. It's filling as a light meal would be (3-4 hours as opposed to the advertised 3-6 hours). Didn't really experience the ""detox"" side-effects that others have mentioned (at least nothing I wouldn't experience from a high-fiber meal), but I also chased it with a bottle of water.As other reviewers mentioned, this is a bit of a ""stone soup fable"" misnomer. If you add 1/2-cup berries, 1/2 apple, and a banana (along w/cup of soymilk), this will be a pretty filling, higher-calorie (but nutritionally dense) meal.It's completely organic, vegan, kosher, free of glutens, soy, yeast, salt, dairy, egg, and cholesterol. The protein (16 g) is from vegan sources (quinoa/millet, amaranth, brown rice, spirulina).Says it's unsweetened, but other astute reviewers have pointed out there's stevia (a natural alternative calorie-free sweetener).

Amazon is the worst about sending items completely unprotected and causing them to be broken when they arrive. This item was shipped in a box far too big for it and the only thing protecting it was a single piece of bubble packaging on the TOP of the item, not on the bottom where it would need the cushion. I will say that my chin loves this thing, sleeps on it constantly. But it is very brittle granite. Not nearly worth the price. We have a big cage with 4 levels, so I've decided to put another one of these on the second level as well, HOWEVER, I am using one of those granite cutting boards instead. Its all the same to them really. They just like anything that keeps them cold.

The design is very poor, in my opinion, at least compared to other treat toys we've used.To begin with, it is difficult to ""load"" the toy with food and treats because there are two identical loading holes, one opposite the other. This means that when I pour treats in, they pour right out on the opposite side. It's like filling a bucket with no bottom, and it's very frustrating. Eventually, you have to just find the biggest treats you can, and jam them in, which is a pain and a half. Not to mention the edges of the hole catch and grab at your fingers - fun!That brings me to my next point - you cannot put small treats or puppy kibble in here as they will fall out immediately. Only big fat treats will provide the dog a challenge, but fortunately the makers of this product make such treats and are more than willing to sell them to you. Which is fine, I guess, and I went ahead and bought some, but I prefer to fill my treat toys with at least some regular kibble so that the puppy doesn't just gorge himself on a bunch of rich treats all at once. Since this ball won't allow me to do this, it's now an occasional toy, not a reliable daily toy.Bottom line",pet supplies,dogs,toys,244,pet supplies,True

As a dental surgery assistant I agree that it is very similar to the kind of attachments that we use for filing and shaping teeth - especially prosthetics - in the surgery, and must therefore be used with great care as the attachments could cause a lot of damage.I was tempted to buy the Homedics system as I thought that using the appliance as gently as possible might be useful - but the comment about the appliance being difficult to charge up/recharge for use has made me decide not to purchase this particular appliance.I hope that the manufacturers of this appliance will take note of their customers' comments and attempt to produce a much better product.Bearing in mind my comments about damage to the extremeties (hands and feet) it could be a potentially dangerous product for diabetic patients if injury occurs with its use.",beauty,tools accessories,nail tools,244,health personal care,False

The disc is hard, even in the fleece cover it comes with, so I place it under his bed and on top of a heat-reflecting blanket. Insulated in this manner, the disc is still warm to the touch in the morning, even after 12 hours.The SnuggleSafe has saved my sanity. My only wish is that is was a little softer so he'd be comfortable sleeping directly on it rather than having to pad it with extra fleece or his bed.

Well, my temperature was all over the place and I couldn't tell a thing from it. Ironically, I went to see him again at the beginning of this cycle and he gave me a prescription for clomid that I would have started taking the beginning of my next cycle....but thanks to the fertility monitor I do not have to take any drugs! And this baby will be due right around Christmas :) Merry Christmas to me! I sincerely wish you all the best of luck and hopefully my story will give other women hope!! God bless!(P.S.

The wasabi is scorchingly spicy, the rice vinegar is tangy, and the rice cooks and clumps together with ease. The soy sauce and wasabi are so good, in fact, that I would go out of my way to buy them if I saw them at a store somewhere.But, the best part of this kit is the manual. It's straightforward, written in simple English, and has very nice photos. As I read each page of instructions, I feel like I'm being walked through step-by-step by a close friend.

I do warn that it will take some serious practice to get skilled with this. I'm still learning. It gets hot, but don't worry it doesn't get too hot (I consider it a safe-hot temperature). No need for a temperature control, it goes right to the perfect temperature to get the best results and the best hair quality. By the way, DO NOT go and buy some cheaper hair straightener!!

The curls last until I wash them out, but I think that's just because my hair holds a curl anyway (I can make curls with my fingers and a blow dryer that last for days...) Anyway, some people complain the caruso-steam curls don't last so if your hair doesn't hold a curl, anyway, these might or might not work for you.

The shaver/trimmer attachment for the device is very nice, and does a wonderful job on the bikini line.I've been using this method of hair removal for over 15 years and I've seen many posts that complain about ""stubble"". The stubble is a by-product of hairs that break off, rather than get pulled out, while using the epilation process. For first time users, or if you haven't used the product for a long time, this is very common. First, the length of the hair is important. If it's too long, it will likely break off, especially if the machine only grabs the hair at the end. However, if you use the shaver/trimmer head first, to cut the hairs to optimal length, it will greatly reduce the amount of breakage that occurs. For the hairs that do break, simply allow a day or two for them to grow out a bit, and reuse the epilator to extract them.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,267,health personal care,True

But I was out of bleach, and decided to try this kit just for kicks and touch up my teeth. I was impressed by the mouth trays, that they were able to mold to your teeth. However, a real bleach tray stops at your gum-line and this one went WAY past mine. Obviously they have to make it one size fits all, but the bleach is what causes soreness on your gums. My teeth are very sensitive if I bleach too often. The sensitivity wasn't an issue until I reached the fourth session. After that it hurt, but now after 2 days, my teeth feel fine. As far as the effectiveness, I didn't think it worked well enough for me to consider using this again. My teeth were a little brighter, but it was hardly noticeable. I suppose for people with really bad stains it might be more effective. I wish that they had included one of those tooth shade guides. It would've been nice to match shades and see if it had done anything.

So, we used it once for that trip and never again. Instead, we bought a back-pack that holds his regular car seats as well as other stuff, and that works great for getting around the airport with an umbrella stroller.

Gemma is an army green color, and in the bottle, you can see the contrast dichroic-type effect of pale purple shimmer. However, once it's on the nails, that dichro effect is lost. It simply looks like a shiny army green. I think that the difference between regular ambient light in a room (or outdoors) and the pale purple shimmer is simply not great enough to show a difference. If you're looking for army green, go for it. If you're looking for dichroic effect, keep looking.On the plus side, I did my nails last night and have spent about 10 hours typing since then, and they show no wear at all. Right now I'm using OPI's Natural Nail Base Coat and Top Coat, but I have the Zoya products on order (Ulta didn't stock those). I'm hoping the all-Zoya combo will give me a super long wear. I'll come back and report in when this one starts to show wear, and also after my first all-Zoya manicure begins to show wear. So far, I recommend!Edit. Zoya took a really long time to ship out my stuff. My Gemma manicure lasted 10 days with only minimal edge wear (which only I could see; people talking to me couldn't tell). I was bored with the color, so I went to Ulta and bought ""Sarah"" (a metallic red) and did that with Orly's ""Top 2 Bottom"" base/top coat. So far this has lasted 5 days and is not showing wear.Of course the Zoya stuff showed up the next day. So I stripped the ""Sarah"" manicure off my right hand and used the Zoya Anchor base coat, 2 coats of Sarah, and the Armor top coat. This has lasted 4 days so far (no wear). I'm really impressed with the longevity of this nail polish. I used to be an all-OPI girl, but when their stuff started chipping within a day I decided it was time to look elsewhere.
